Even after the fall of Western Rome,\\nLatin remained the common language of international communication, science, scholarship and academia in Europe until well into the 18th century, when \\nother regional vernaculars (including its own descendants, the Romance languages) supplanted it in common academic and political usage. For most of the\\ntime it was used, it would be considered a \"dead language\" in the modern linguistic definition; that is, it lacked native speakers, despite being used \\nextensively and actively.\\n\\nLatin is a highly inflected language, with three distinct genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), six or seven noun cases (nominative, accusative, \\ngenitive, dative, ablative, and vocative), five declensions, four verb conjugations, six tenses (present, imperfect, future, perfect, pluperfect, and \\nfuture perfect), three persons, three moods, two voices (passive and active), two or three aspects, and two numbers (singular and plural). The Latin \\nalphabet is directly derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.\\n\\n'"
