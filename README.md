Latin (lingua Latīna [ˈlɪŋɡʷa ɫaˈtiːna] or Latīnum [ɫaˈtiːnʊ̃]) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. 
Latin was originally a dialect spoken in Latium (also known as Lazio), the lower Tiber area around present-day Rome,[1] but through the power of the 
Roman Republic it became the dominant language in the Italian region and subsequently throughout the Roman Empire. Even after the fall of Western Rome,
Latin remained the common language of international communication, science, scholarship and academia in Europe until well into the 18th century, when 
other regional vernaculars (including its own descendants, the Romance languages) supplanted it in common academic and political usage. For most of 
the time it was used, it would be considered a "dead language" in the modern linguistic definition; that is, it lacked native speakers, despite being 
used extensively and actively.

Latin is a highly inflected language, with three distinct genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), six or seven noun cases (nominative, accusative,
genitive, dative, ablative, and vocative), five declensions, four verb conjugations, six tenses (present, imperfect, future, perfect, pluperfect, and
future perfect), three persons, three moods, two voices (passive and active), two or three aspects, and two numbers (singular and plural). The Latin 
alphabet is directly derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.
